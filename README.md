# Loan_Payment_Optimizer

## Descripton:
Python code to determine how to allocate extra money to pay off debt faster.

## Basic explanation:

You have a bunch of debts. They are probably in the form loans paid off
in installments over time. These are know as amortized loans.

Examples of amortized loans include credit card debts, mortgages, 
and student loans.

The mantra I've seen over and over again, is that the optimal way to pay
off these debts is something called the "higher rate" or "descending interest" 
method by which you pay off your debts by interest rate from highest to
lowest [1].

I wanted to test to see if the descending interest method was always optimal.

## System requirements:
- Python 3.X
- No obscure Python libraries required.
