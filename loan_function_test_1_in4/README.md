# Description of test
1. 10271580 scenarios were run. There were 3 loans per scenario.
    * The scenarios were generated by computing all possible combinations of 
3 loans from all possible combinations of "p," "i," and "n."
    * See one of the "loan_function_test*.py" codes for more details.
2. For each scenario, the total cost was computed using the 
"gradient descent" and "descending interest" methods.
3. If the total cost using "gradient descent" was less than that of "descending
interest" then this was considered a "win." Otherwise it was considered a "loss."
4. The scenarios were partitioned into 4 separate codes that could be run
simultaneously.
5. A crude form a parallel processing.
6. This was done out of laziness for not taking the time to actually learn
how to parallel process in Python.
